/**
 * The data door: export this app's own state, and put it back, for a caller we can identify.
 *
 * ## Why a provider and not the broadcast receiver next to it
 *
 * Two reasons, and the first is the whole point of the redesign.
 *
 * **A broadcast cannot tell you who sent it.** The old contract's answer to that was a shared
 * secret, which cannot survive the wipe that this feature exists to recover from. A provider gets
 * the caller's identity from the framework for free — see [AutomationCallers] for what is actually
 * checked and why a package-name prefix would have been worse than the token it replaced.
 *
 * **A list needs a synchronous answer.** 応用管理 draws a row per installed app before any export
 * exists; a broadcast round trip per app to fill a list is the wrong shape entirely.
 *
 * ## What does NOT happen here
 *
 * The payload. `call()` validates, starts a foreground service and returns — a podcast library's
 * realm snapshot is tens or hundreds of megabytes over minutes, and inside a binder call that would
 * block the caller, report no progress, refuse cancellation and die silently if this process were
 * killed. The bytes go through a file descriptor the caller opened, and the terminal answer comes
 * back on the broadcast the family already proved on EMUI.
 *
 * ## Why a descriptor and not a path
 *
 * Because a backup is not a stable directory while it is being assembled. 応用管理 writes into a
 * temporary path and renames on commit; it encrypts and checksums **per file it knows about**. A
 * file this app dropped into that directory itself would be renamed out from under it, would sit in
 * plaintext inside an encrypted backup, and would be unverified rather than verified-and-failing
 * (応用管理, 2026-09-04). A descriptor is also a capability that **expires when it is closed**.
 *
 * ## Why `import` lives only here
 *
 * An import overwrites this app's whole database, and the §1 receiver is `exported="true"` with no
 * permission. An import action there would let any app on the phone wipe any sister app.
